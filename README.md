Snapper is a prototype bot for Discord that is supposed to take a sreenshot, upload it to a image hosting site and post the link - all of that after pressing one hotkey.

Currently Snapper reacts to a command typed to him directly (which is not super useful, let's be honest) and takes a screenshot of the machine it runs on.
